function [res, Pol] = Curve2Spline(Curve)
%   Takes a Curve and the associated sampling and returns a 3rd degree Spline approximation,
%   continuous and differentiable.
%   The curve is supposed to be a sampled cycle, with the first and last values equal
%   Due to constraints, the spline is located on a [0 1] interval and is periodical,
%   Spline(0)==Spline(1), the sampling is conserved.
